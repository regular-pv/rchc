args:
  - INPUT:
      help: Input SMT2-lib file.
      index: 1
  - verbose:
      long: verbose
      short: v

        a learning sample has been found for every falsifiable clause.
  - max-states:
      long: max-states
      short: m
      help: Set the upper limit on the number of states in the created automatic
        relations. If there is no model where all predicates state count is below
        this limit, then the solver will return `unknown`.
